 * @brief Data access module
 * 
 * Specifically, components found within this layer can access database tables and
 * manipulate data. Access is done through components called 'drivers', and data
 * mapping is done through components called 'models'. Within a web application,
 * each database table can map to a model that provides easy access to some of the
 * most commmon operations : select, insert, update, delete.
