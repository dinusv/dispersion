 * @brief Framework exceptions
 * 
 * Exceptions can have a variety of usses. Dispersion uses these internally either to
 * indicate logic errors or to interrupt a sequence in order to signal an event. The 
 * PageNotFoundException for example eases url-checking within the controller of a
 * web application.
